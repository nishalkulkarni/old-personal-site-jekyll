<section>
	Hi, my name is Nishal Kulkarni, I am a freshman undergraduate student at the Vellore Institute of Technology pursuing a degree in computer science and engineering. 
I am from Pune if you ask Google what's so special about Pune you will get to know that it is the cultural capital of Maharashtra and a place with a booming software industry but if you ask me it is a place filled with a bunch of lazy braggarts and loudmouths. I tell you this because you can get to know a lot about a person and the choices he or she makes by knowing where he or she is from. You will get to know how these personality traits are infused in me throughout the rest of my speech.
My interest in computers and all things related to it, started by making 2D-animations and developing websites using HTML+CSS, during my preadolescence. During my adolescence, I developed an android app which helped a person in an emergency by notifying nearby people (think of it as an advanced SOS system).
In the past few years, I have learnt elementary game development through Unity and backend web development using PHP, MySQL and NodeJs. I used these skills to win second prize at the ThoughtWorks-Hackathon where I developed a website which helped students to make an informed decision while taking admission. 
Academically, I was consistently in the top three of my class during junior-college and always topped in computer science. In my 12th ISC-boards, I obtained the first rank in computer science, overall fourth rank in the science stream and was the topper of my class.
I like to spend my leisure time reading a book, I read mostly non-fiction, speedcubing is also one of my hobbies although this hobby has helped me win several medals too. I also love learning new languages, I hope to become a pentalingual by the end of this year. Like others, I too waste a lot of time playing video games. In terms of physical activity, as you can see, I am not a sportsperson. I mostly play indoor sports especially table tennis.
Now that I am done bragging about my strengths I'll move on to my weakness. I usually don't like highlighting my weaknesses but the ones I feel comfortable sharing now are that I have imposter syndrome and hypochondria. Nowadays though, being overwhelmed by my peers forces me to work harder and not give up like the way I did before. Therefore imposter syndrome has become a coping mechanism instead of a disability for me. Coming to my hypochondria, I have this bad habit of googling anything that I find wrong with my body and usually, the first search result says that I have cancer which again makes me more psychosomatic. The way I get over this problem is by affirming myself that all of us are going to die one day anyway, so I should stop wasting my time thinking about how that will happen.
Another weakness of mine is lack of proper time management, this is not to say that I procrastinate a lot, It is just that when there is a lot of stuff to do I fail to prioritize and hence run out of time to complete my work.
The only threat which comes to my mind is, living in a hostel, now that there is no supervision and plenty of distractions I could easily spend all night playing video games or push my laziness to inhuman levels. But this is yet to happen. It has been a month now and I have managed to control my temptations pretty well.
There is a lot to talk about when it comes to opportunities, focusing on opportunities in college, the things which fascinate me are open-source software and competitive coding for which VIT has various chapters and clubs to help me realize my potential and enable me to set a long-term goal and start working towards it. With the help of VIT's esteemed faculty and accomplished peers, this programme will allow me to gain the expertise required to make a meaningful impact in this society.
Again, I am Nishal Kulkarni, you can contact me on any social media platform, my handle everywhere is my full name, thank you for listening.
