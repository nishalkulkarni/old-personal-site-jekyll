      <p>
        I'm a Computer Science student at the <a href="http://www.vit.ac.in/" class="para-link" target="_blank">Vellore Institute of Technology</a>. When Iâ€™m not busy completing assignments, you can find me working on my <a href="projects.html" class="para-link">side projects</a>, reading a book (mostly nonfiction), learning a new language, playing table tennis and video games.
			</p>
      <p>
        Other than the things listed above, I also have a long <a href="bucketlist.html" class="para-link">bucket list</a>. If you like me so far and want to know more, this website is full of <a href="journal.html" class="para-link">articles</a> documenting my ideas, opinions, achievements and valuable lessons I have learned ever since I started this website.
